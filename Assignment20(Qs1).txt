Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.In JavaScript, there are primarily three types of conditional statements: if, else if, and else.

i) if statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

javascript code:

if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Example:

javascript code:

let num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
}

ii) if-else statement:
The if-else statement allows you to specify two blocks of code: one to be executed if the condition is true and another if the condition is false.

javascript code:

if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
Example:

javascript code:

let num = -5;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("The number is non-positive");
}

iii) if-else if-else statement:
The if-else if-else statement allows you to chain multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first true condition.

javascript code:

if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if no conditions are true
}
Example:

javascript code:

let num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("The number is negative");
} else {
    console.log("The number is zero");
}

    These conditional statements help control the flow of your program based on different conditions, allowing you to create dynamic and responsive code.
