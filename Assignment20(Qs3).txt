Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Ans.Loops in programming are structures that allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and performing operations until a certain condition is met. In JavaScript, there are several types of loops, including for, while, and do-while.

--->Loops are crucial in JavaScript for several reasons:

i)Automating Repetitive Tasks: When you need to perform a task multiple times with slight variations, loops help avoid duplicating code.

javascript code:

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}

ii)Iteration over Arrays/Objects: Loops are commonly used to iterate through elements in an array or properties in an object.

javascript code:

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i]);
}

iii)Dynamic Code Execution: Loops enable dynamic execution of code based on changing conditions, enhancing the flexibility and responsiveness of our programs.

Understanding and using loops effectively in JavaScript is essential for writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

-->Different types of loops with their syntax and examples:
i) for loop:
The for loop is commonly used how many times we want to execute a block of code.

javascript code of for loop syntax:

for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:

javascript code:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

ii) while loop:
The while loop is used when we want to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

javascript code of while loop syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:

javascript code:

let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

iii) do-while loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.

javascript code of do-while loop syntax:

do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:

javascript code:

let i = 0;

do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
